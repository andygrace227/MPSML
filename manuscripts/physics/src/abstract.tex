	Quantum critical phases of matter are theoretically challenging to predict. Here we 
	show that a physics guided machine can detect a quantum transition where the best 
	unguided machine fails.

	%\textcolor{red}{Hypothesis:} Neural networks are not usually the most
	%effective means of solving problems where the number of inputs are far less
	%than the number of outputs.  In addition to needing many exposures to the
	%phase space of interest, it is often the case that sparse inputs lead to
	%vanishing gradients in the most robust training algorithms.  However, by
	%inducing an cost in such a way that a network's outputs are consistent with
	%an analytical condition connecting the outputs with the inputs, we find the
	%equations of motion for the network parameters, and show that learning and
	%performance is enhanced in this procedure. In many situations where
	%knowledge of a physical system is available, but direct sampling of the
	%entire phase space is computationally intractable, the addition of a
	%physics prior is shown to enable accelerated learning and better
	%extrapolative predictions.
