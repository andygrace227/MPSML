We have demonstrated that the addition of an intelligence prior can greatly
improve the learning capabilities and predictive power of soft computational
intelligence engines. In the most rudimentary of circumstances, the
improvements are vast. With the ever increasing importance of precipitating
valuable information from effecitvely infinite amounts of chaotic data, succint
training routines for neural networks are critical. Although we have
demonstrated the efficacy of this approach as applied to quantum phase
transitions in model systems, the basic premise is widely applicable to any
system that follows known laws of motion in the generalized sense. This
strongly suggests the art of machine intelligence should be refined to include
the aformentioned precepts, and we suspect that leveraging this technique will
find application accross many areas of physics and engineering.
