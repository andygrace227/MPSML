The model we employ is the generalized transverse field Ising chain with a 
longitudinal field and periodic boundary conditions. The Hamiltonian 
is given by
\begin{equation}
	H = J \sum_{i=0}^{N-1} \sigma_i^z \sigma_{i+1}^z - B_x \sum_{i=0}^{N-1}
	\sigma_i^x  - B_z \sum_{i=0}^{N-1} \sigma_i^z,
\end{equation}
where the operators are understood to be the $N$ fold product of Pauli space as
\begin{equation}
	\sigma_i = \mathbf{1} \otimes ... \otimes \sigma \otimes \mathbf{1} ...
	\otimes \mathbf{1};
\end{equation}
$J, B_x, B_z$ are the coupling, transverse, and longitudinal fields
respectively.  The phase diagram of this model is has been studied
recently~\cite{bonfim2019} using exact diagonalization of spin chains up to 16
spins.
