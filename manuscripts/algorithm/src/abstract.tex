	Improving the predictive power of machine learning models is one of the
	greatest challenges to the science of learning. Here we demonstrate with
	the simplest of neural networks that the addition of an intelligence prior
	can drastically improve the learning capabilities.  We outline this simple
	mechanism to decrease the number of exposures, and enhance the predictive
	power with a number of examples relevant to the study of quantum phase
	transitions. We find that guided networks are uniquely capable to identify
	key features of quantum phases where unguided models fail, and that while 
	the mean square error of topologically equivalent models may be commensurate, 
	the structure of the predictions produced by the models is qualitatively 
	very different. In many situations where knowledge of a physical system is  
	available, but direct sampling of the entire phase space is computationally 
	intractable, this approach offers a superior learning alternative.
